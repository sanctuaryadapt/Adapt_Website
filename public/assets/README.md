# Media Assets Guide

To replace the placeholders with your actual images, follow these steps:

## 1. Directory Structure
We have created specific folders for your assets:
- `public/assets/products/` (Place tBot and GoldBucket images here)
- `public/assets/research/` (Place Khuld and Darwin images here)
- `public/assets/blogs/` (Place blog cover images here)

## 2. Naming Convention
For automatic integration (once we update the code to use them), recommend using simple names:
- `public/assets/products/tbot.jpg`
- `public/assets/products/goldbucket.jpg`
- `public/assets/research/khuld.jpg`
- `public/assets/research/darwin.jpg`
- `public/assets/blogs/blog1.jpg`

## 3. How to Add Files
**Option A: Copy them yourself**
If you have access to the file system, simply drag and drop your images into these folders.

**Option B: Let me do it**
Tell me the **absolute path** to the images on your computer.
*Example:* "My images are in `/home/xanta/Downloads/website-assets/`"
I will then copy them for you.
